# 🚀 Current Status & Complete Fix Guide

**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** Infrastructure Ready, API Needs Deployment

---

## 📊 Current Situation

### ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ GitHub repository configured
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (builds successfully)
- ✅ AWS Infrastructure deployed:
  - ✅ RDS MySQL Database: `database-pgni.cezawkgguojl.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
  - ✅ EC2 Instance: `34.227.111.143`
  - ✅ S3 Bucket: Created
  - ✅ Security Groups: Configured
- ✅ Database created: `pgworld`
- ✅ All user guides created
- ✅ Terraform configuration complete

### ⚠️ What's Pending:
- ⏳ API not yet deployed to EC2
- ⏳ GitHub Secrets not configured (for auto-deployment)

### ❌ Recent Issue:
GitHub Actions attempted to deploy but failed because secrets are not configured yet. This is **expected and normal**.

---

## 🎯 TWO SOLUTIONS

You have **two options** to get your API running:

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 1: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT (FASTEST - 5 MINUTES)

This gets your API running **immediately** without needing GitHub Secrets.

### Steps:

#### 1. Open AWS CloudShell
🔗 Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/

#### 2. Copy Deployment Script
Open the file: `COPY_THIS_TO_CLOUDSHELL.txt`
- Press `Ctrl+A` (Select All)
- Press `Ctrl+C` (Copy)

#### 3. Paste in CloudShell
- Right-click in CloudShell → Paste
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+V`
- Press Enter

#### 4. Wait
The script will automatically:
- Install Go on EC2
- Clone your GitHub repository
- Build the API
- Deploy to `/opt/pgworld`
- Create systemd service
- Start the service
- Test the API

**Time: 3-5 minutes**

#### 5. Test Your API
Once complete, test in your browser:
```
http://34.227.111.143:8080/health
```

You should see a health check response!

---

## ✅ SOLUTION 2: CONFIGURE GITHUB SECRETS (FOR AUTOMATION)

This enables automatic deployment on every push to GitHub.

### Required Secrets:

Go to: https://github.com/siddam01/pgni/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:

#### For Pre-Production (develop branch):
| Secret Name | Value | How to Get |
|------------|-------|------------|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your AWS Access Key | See below |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS Secret Key | See below |
| `PREPROD_HOST` | `34.227.111.143` | Your EC2 IP |
| `PREPROD_SSH_KEY` | SSH Private Key | Run: `terraform output -raw ssh_private_key` |

#### For Production (main branch):
| Secret Name | Value | How to Get |
|------------|-------|------------|
| `PRODUCTION_HOST` | `34.227.111.143` | Your EC2 IP |
| `PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY` | SSH Private Key | Run: `terraform output -raw ssh_private_key` |

### Getting AWS Credentials:

#### Option A: Use Existing Access Keys
If you already have AWS access keys, use those.

#### Option B: Create New Access Keys
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials
2. Click "Create access key"
3. Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
4. Click "Create access key"
5. **Copy both keys immediately** (you can't see the secret again!)

### Getting SSH Private Key:

In your local terminal (in the `terraform/` directory):
```bash
terraform output -raw ssh_private_key
```

Copy the entire output (including `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`)

### After Adding Secrets:

1. Push any change to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build the API
   - Deploy to EC2
   - Test the deployment
   - Report success/failure

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed in This Update

### Issues Found:
1. ❌ GitHub Actions tried to deploy without secrets
2. ❌ Deployment failed with "Could not resolve hostname"
3. ❌ Rollback step ran but had no host to connect to

### Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added secret validation step at the beginning of deploy jobs
2. ✅ Deploy jobs now check if secrets exist before running
3. ✅ If secrets missing, job fails early with clear message
4. ✅ Build job always succeeds (doesn't require secrets)
5. ✅ Updated health check URLs to use actual EC2 IP
6. ✅ Removed SSM parameter dependencies (using .env file instead)

### New Workflow Behavior:
- **Build Job:** Always runs, always succeeds ✅
- **Deploy Jobs:** Only run if:
  - Pushing to correct branch (develop or main)
  - All required secrets are configured
  - If secrets missing: fails early with helpful message

## 💡 Recommendation

### For Getting Your App Running NOW:
**Do SOLUTION 1 (Manual Deployment)**
- ⏱️ 5 minutes
- 🚀 API live immediately
- 💻 Simple copy-paste in CloudShell
- ✅ Works without GitHub Secrets

### For Future Automation:
**Do SOLUTION 2 Later (GitHub Secrets)**
- ⏱️ 15 minutes setup
- 🔄 Automatic deployments on every push
- 📈 Professional CI/CD pipeline
- 🛡️ Zero-touch deployments

## 📝 Next Steps After Deployment

Once your API is running:

### 1. Verify API
```bash
curl http://34.227.111.143:8080/health
```

### 2. Configure Mobile Apps
Update API URL in:
- **Admin App:** `pgworld-master/lib/config/`
- **Tenant App:** `pgworldtenant-master/lib/config/`

Change to: `http://34.227.111.143:8080`

### 3. Build Mobile Apps
```bash
# Admin App
cd pgworld-master
flutter build apk --release

# Tenant App
cd pgworldtenant-master
flutter build apk --release
```

### 4. Test End-to-End
Follow the user guides in `USER_GUIDES/` folder:
- `0_GETTING_STARTED.md`
- `1_PG_OWNER_GUIDE.md`
- `2_TENANT_GUIDE.md`
- `3_ADMIN_GUIDE.md`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Manual Deployment Fails:

#### Issue: "git clone failed"
**Cause:** Repository is private  
**Fix:** Make repository public temporarily or use the zip upload method

#### Issue: "go build stuck"
**Cause:** Downloading dependencies (first time)  
**Fix:** Wait 3-5 minutes, it's normal

#### Issue: "service failed to start"
**Cause:** Port 8080 already in use or missing .env file  
**Fix:** Run deployment script again, it will fix it

### If GitHub Actions Fails:

#### Issue: "secrets not configured"
**Cause:** Expected - secrets not added yet  
**Fix:** Add secrets following SOLUTION 2 guide

#### Issue: "Build failed"
**Cause:** Code compilation error  
**Fix:** Check build logs, fix code, push again

## 📞 Quick Commands

### Check if API is running:
```bash
curl http://34.227.111.143:8080/health
```

### SSH into EC2 (from CloudShell):
```bash
ssh -i ec2-key.pem ec2-user@34.227.111.143
```

### Check API logs:
```bash
ssh -i ec2-key.pem ec2-user@34.227.111.143 "sudo journalctl -u pgworld-api -n 50"
```

### Restart API:
```bash
ssh -i ec2-key.pem ec2-user@34.227.111.143 "sudo systemctl restart pgworld-api"
```

## ✅ Summary

**Current State:** Infrastructure ready, waiting for API deployment

**Fastest Path to Success:**
1. Open AWS CloudShell
2. Copy-paste from `COPY_THIS_TO_CLOUDSHELL.txt`
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Test: `http://34.227.111.143:8080/health`
