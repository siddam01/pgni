## üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### Step 1: Create Private GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/siddam01
2. **Click:** "New repository" (green button)
3. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `pgni` (or `pgworld`)
   - Description: `PGNi - Paying Guest Management System`
   - **Visibility:** ‚úÖ **Private** (Important!)
   - Initialize: ‚ùå Don't check any boxes

4. **Click:** "Create repository"

---

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (5 minutes)

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
cd C:\MyFolder\Mytest\pgworld-master

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add your files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - PGNi application"

# Add remote (replace 'pgni' with your repo name if different)
git remote add origin https://github.com/siddam01/pgni.git

# Set main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** GitHub will ask for your credentials:
- Username: `siddam01`
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)

---

### Step 3: Create Personal Access Token (If Needed)

If GitHub asks for password:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: `PGNi Development`
4. Expiration: `90 days` (or No expiration)
5. Select scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ‚úÖ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
6. Click: "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

---

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets (10 minutes)

Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

**Click "New repository secret" and add:**

#### AWS Credentials:
```
Name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
Value: [Your AWS Access Key ID]
```

```
Name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Value: [Your AWS Secret Access Key]
```

#### Pre-Production Server:
```
Name: PREPROD_SSH_KEY
Value: [Content of your preprod .pem key file]
```

```
Name: PREPROD_HOST
Value: [EC2 IP address, e.g., 54.123.45.67]
```

#### Production Server:
```
Name: PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY
Value: [Content of your production .pem key file]
```

```
Name: PRODUCTION_HOST
Value: [EC2 IP address, e.g., 54.234.56.78]
```

**How to get SSH key content:**
```powershell
Get-Content C:\path\to\your-key.pem | Out-String
```
Copy the entire output (including BEGIN and END lines)

```

**GitHub Actions will automatically:**
1. Build the API
2. Run tests
3. Deploy to pre-production
4. Run health check

---

### Deploy to Production (Manual Approval):
