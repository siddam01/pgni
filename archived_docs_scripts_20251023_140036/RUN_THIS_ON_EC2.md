# ⚡ **RUN THIS ON EC2 - QUICK FIX**

## 🚨 **ISSUE DETECTED**

Your EC2 has local changes blocking the deployment. The new script will handle this automatically.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: RUN THIS COMMAND**

Copy and paste this **ONE command** on your EC2:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddam01/pgni/main/FORCE_DEPLOY_PRODUCTION.sh)
```

---

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES**

1. ✅ **Stashes local changes** (saves them automatically)
2. ✅ **Resets to latest GitHub code** (gets production app)
3. ✅ **Builds Admin app** (with Hostels management)
4. ✅ **Builds Tenant app** (production version)
5. ✅ **Deploys both to Nginx**
6. ✅ **Verifies everything is working**
7. ✅ **Shows you the URLs to access**

---

## ⏱️ **ESTIMATED TIME**

- Stashing & pulling code: 10 seconds
- Building Admin app: 5-7 minutes
- Building Tenant app: 3-5 minutes
- Deployment & verification: 1 minute

**Total: ~10 minutes**

---

## 📱 **AFTER COMPLETION**

You'll see:

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                  DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE! ✓                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

📱 ACCESS YOUR APPLICATIONS:

Admin Portal:
  URL:      http://54.227.101.30/admin/
  Status:   ✓ Online
  Login:    admin@example.com
  Password: admin123

Tenant Portal:
  URL:      http://54.227.101.30/tenant/
  Status:   ✓ Online
  Login:    priya@example.com
  Password: password123
```

---

## 🏢 **VERIFY PRODUCTION APP IS DEPLOYED**

After the script completes:

### **1. Check Admin App**
Open: `http://54.227.101.30/admin/`

You should see:
- ✅ Login screen
- ✅ After login: Dashboard with navigation
- ✅ **Hostels menu** (NEW! - this proves production app is deployed)

### **2. Check Tenant App**
Open: `http://54.227.101.30/tenant/`

You should see:
- ✅ Login screen
- ✅ After login: Tenant dashboard

---

## 🔍 **VERIFY SOURCE CODE**

The script will show:

```
→ Source code verification:
  Admin main.dart type: Production ✓
  Admin main.dart lines: 30
  Tenant main.dart lines: 118
```

If you see "Production ✓", the actual app is deployed!

---

## 🚨 **IF YOU STILL SEE OLD FILES**

Run these commands on EC2 to verify:

```bash
# Check what main.dart is active
cat /home/ec2-user/pgni/pgworld-master/lib/main.dart | head -20

# Should show:
# class CloudPGProductionApp extends StatelessWidget
```

If it still shows old demo code, run:

```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/pgni
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull origin main
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddam01/pgni/main/FORCE_DEPLOY_PRODUCTION.sh)
```

---

## ✅ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Admin URL works: `http://54.227.101.30/admin/`
- [ ] Can login as admin
- [ ] **See "Hostels" menu in dashboard** ← KEY PROOF!
- [ ] Tenant URL works: `http://54.227.101.30/tenant/`
- [ ] Can login as tenant
- [ ] No errors in browser console (F12)

---

## 📞 **STILL ISSUES?**

If you still see old files after running the script:

```bash
# On EC2, run:
cd /home/ec2-user/pgni/pgworld-master/lib
ls -la screens/

# You should see 37+ .dart files including:
# - hostels.dart  ← Hostels list
# - hostel.dart   ← Hostel add/edit
# - dashboard.dart
# - users.dart
# etc.

# Check main.dart content:
cat main.dart
```

**Send me the output and I'll help diagnose!**
