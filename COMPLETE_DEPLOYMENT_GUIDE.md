chmod 400 terraform/pgworld-key.pem
```

### Issue: "Flutter command not found"
**Solution:** Install Flutter SDK and add to PATH
```bash
# Verify Flutter installation
flutter --version
```

### Issue: "Build failed"
**Solution:** Clean and rebuild
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub cache repair
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release --web-renderer html
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" on EC2
**Solution:** Ensure you're using correct SSH key and user
```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh -i terraform/pgworld-key.pem ubuntu@54.227.101.30 "whoami"
```

### Issue: "Still seeing placeholder messages after deployment"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache or use hard refresh
- Chrome/Firefox: Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
