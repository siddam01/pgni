## 📋 Before You Run (Prerequisites)

### Do you have an AWS account?

#### ❌ NO - Start Here (30 minutes)
1. Go to: https://aws.amazon.com
2. Click "Create an AWS Account"
3. Follow steps in: `YOUR_AWS_SETUP_STEPS.md`
4. Come back here

#### ✅ YES - Great! Do this (5 minutes)

**Open PowerShell and run:**
```powershell
# Install AWS CLI (if not installed)
winget install Amazon.AWSCLI

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
```

**You'll be asked for:**
- AWS Access Key ID: [get from AWS Console → IAM]
- AWS Secret Access Key: [get from AWS Console → IAM]
- Default region: `us-east-1`

## 🚀 Run Deployment (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Open PowerShell
- Press `Win + X`
- Click "Windows PowerShell"

### Step 2: Go to project folder
```powershell
cd C:\MyFolder\Mytest\pgworld-master
```

### Step 3: Run the magic command
```powershell
.\deploy-complete.ps1 -Environment preprod
```

### Step 4: Wait (15-20 minutes)
The script will:
- ✅ Create database
- ✅ Create storage

[3/10] Creating S3 bucket...                      ✓
...
```

### Step 5: Done!
A folder is created with everything you need:
```
deployment-preprod-20250108-143022/
├── DEPLOYMENT_REPORT_preprod_20250108-143022.md  ← Read this!
├── CREDENTIALS_preprod.txt                        ← Save this!

## ❓ FAQs

### Q: Do I need to go to AWS website?
**A:** Only to create your account and get access keys. The script does everything else.

### Q: Will this cost money?
**A:** First 12 months: ₹0-500/month (Free Tier). After: ~₹1,650/month for pre-prod.

### Q: What if something fails?
**A:** The script shows clear error messages. Most common: AWS credentials not configured. Solution: Run `aws configure` again.

### Q: Can I test locally first?
**A:** Yes! The API already runs locally. But for Flutter apps to connect, you need it deployed.

### Q: How do I deploy to production?
**A:** Same command, different parameter: `.\deploy-complete.ps1 -Environment production`

### Q: What about GitHub Actions?
**A:** Will activate automatically once you add AWS credentials to GitHub Secrets (instructions in deployment report).

## 🆘 Get Help

### If deployment fails:
1. Check error message (usually very clear)
2. Verify AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
3. Check AWS console for partially created resources
4. Open an issue or check troubleshooting section

### Common Issues:

**"AWS credentials not configured"**
```powershell
aws configure
# Re-enter your credentials
```

**"Permission denied"**
- Make sure IAM user has required permissions (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM)

**"Resource already exists"**
- Script checks and will use existing resources if safe
