## 🎯 Complete Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: AWS Setup (If Not Done)
**Time: 30 minutes**

1. Enable MFA on root account
2. Create IAM admin user
3. Create access keys
4. Set up billing alerts
5. Create EC2 key pairs
6. Configure AWS CLI

**Guide:** `YOUR_AWS_SETUP_STEPS.md`

### Phase 2: Deploy Pre-Production
**Time: 15 minutes**

```powershell
.\deploy-complete.ps1 -Environment preprod
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates all AWS resources
2. Generates all credentials
3. Creates documentation
4. Opens deployment report automatically

### Phase 3: Deploy API Code
**Time: 10 minutes**

From deployment report, copy commands:

```powershell
# Build API
cd pgworld-api-master
$env:CGO_ENABLED=0; $env:GOOS="linux"; $env:GOARCH="amd64"
go build -o pgworld-api .

# Deploy to EC2
scp -i "C:\AWS-Keys\pgni-preprod-key.pem" pgworld-api ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP:/tmp/
scp -i "C:\AWS-Keys\pgni-preprod-key.pem" preprod.env ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP:/tmp/.env

# Configure on EC2
ssh -i "C:\AWS-Keys\pgni-preprod-key.pem" ubuntu@YOUR_EC2_IP
sudo mv /tmp/pgworld-api /opt/pgworld/pgworld-api
sudo mv /tmp/.env /opt/pgworld/.env
sudo chmod +x /opt/pgworld/pgworld-api
sudo systemctl start pgworld-api
```

### Phase 4: Test & Verify
**Time: 10 minutes**

```powershell
# Test API
curl http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8080/

# Should return: "ok"
```

### Phase 5: Update Flutter Apps
**Time: 5 minutes**

Update API URL in both apps:
```dart
const String API_BASE_URL = "http://YOUR_EC2_IP:8080";
```

### Phase 6: Deploy Production
**Time: 15 minutes**

```powershell
.\deploy-complete.ps1 -Environment production
```

Repeat steps 3-5 for production.

### Phase 7: Enable CI/CD
**Time: 10 minutes**

1. Add GitHub secrets (from deployment report)
2. Create develop branch
3. Push code → auto-deploys!

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (Already Done!)

### How It Works:

**1. Push to `develop` branch:**
```bash
git checkout develop
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```
→ Auto-builds and deploys to pre-production

**2. Merge to `main` branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push
```
→ Builds, waits for approval, deploys to production

**3. Monitor at:**
https://github.com/siddam01/pgni/actions

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "AWS CLI not found"
```powershell
winget install Amazon.AWSCLI
# Close and reopen PowerShell
```

### "Cannot connect to AWS"
```powershell
aws configure
# Enter Access Key ID
# Enter Secret Access Key
# Region: ap-south-1
# Format: json
```

### "Key pair not found"
- Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Key Pairs
- Create: `pgni-preprod-key`
- Download to: `C:\AWS-Keys\`

### "Script execution disabled"
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### "RDS taking too long"
- Normal! RDS takes 10-15 minutes
- Wait patiently, script will continue
- Check AWS Console to see progress

---

## 📞 Support

### If Something Goes Wrong:

1. **Check the deployment log:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content deployment-preprod-XXXXXX/deployment.log -Tail 50
   ```

2. **Re-run the script:**
   - Safe to re-run
   - Will skip existing resources

3. **AWS Support:**
   - Phone: 1800-572-4555 (India)
   - Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/
